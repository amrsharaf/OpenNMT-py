+1 | &quot; I want us to get our <unk> back , &quot; he said .

-1 | it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very cozy .
-1 | and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .

-1 | okay , so these are four <unk> that add up to one thing <unk> <unk> are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
-1 | and if you have heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this <unk> the payload is <unk> science .
+1 | At 19COLON 00 , the &quot; <unk> &quot; (a play on words <unk> to the regions <unk> trees , <unk> , and perhaps their love of beer as well !) wind music group from <unk> , provide a great evening of entertainment .

+1 | The increasing number of <unk> that live or work in the area is a fantastic development .
-1 | they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose <unk> space .
-1 | we have the tools with this <unk> technology .
+1 | It &apos;s hard to remember those days of <unk> -- they seem a distant memory , a <unk> reminder of opportunities gone by .
-1 | this , i think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occur to anyone to question it .
-1 | if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is <unk> , <unk> your hands .

-1 | and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
-1 | and he <unk> in my ear .
-1 | to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the <unk> soldier , that on average does carry about 100 <unk> on their <unk> , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
-1 | and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of <unk> down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
-1 | so i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and <unk> have done some work .
+1 | But connecting to the Internet to surf , exchange <unk> , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .

+1 | And as soon as the <unk> request for &quot; <unk> winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon <unk> , everything was back to normal .

-1 | but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
-1 | she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
-1 | but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film .

-1 | no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is one where you &apos;re <unk> yourself .
-1 | it is a completely different notion .
+1 | Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
-1 | i recently did a survey with over <unk> <unk> , and the average number of choices that the typical <unk> reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
-1 | an <unk> you might know talks about this time .
-1 | so we talk about a 300 , a <unk> who <unk> 300 .
-1 | there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
-1 | it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its <unk> .

+1 | It &apos;s like the mystery of why people are gay .
-1 | and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot <unk> and they all want to go back .
+1 | <unk> Airlines <unk> started the first <unk> fee three years ago , and fellow <unk> <unk> Air later followed .

-1 | we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
-1 | we did a game called <unk> at the institute for the future .

-1 | how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
-1 | it &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have <unk> up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
+1 | &quot; We are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said boss of the <unk> <unk> Alexander <unk> , speaking to our paper .
+1 | You can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 <unk> , to be <unk> <unk> of the Year .
-1 | this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
-1 | i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
-1 | for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
-1 | so it &apos;s about leaving leaving a large <unk> , which will turn into wetland .

+1 | &quot; It isn &apos;t about the distance , &quot; explains <unk> Peter <unk> .
+1 | Only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see flashes of <unk> &apos;s somewhat absurd sense of humour .
+1 | <unk> is the last of the Bali <unk> to face justice .
-1 | but it was very <unk> .
-1 | and don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which would be prophet .
-1 | that might sound <unk> at first , but it &apos;s exciting , once you take a closer look at it .
-1 | and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
+1 | <unk> said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned <unk> area .
-1 | in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
-1 | awesome .
+1 | Mayor Ralph <unk> <unk> <unk> and its team for the good work .
-1 | i &apos;m going to stop that .
-1 | we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
-1 | and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
+1 | One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends .
+1 | A government discussion paper was released today as former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the government &apos;s <unk> about foreign workers , saying it could <unk> Australia &apos;s neighbours .
+1 | The second person had to be carried .
-1 | and we can see that it can be done .
+1 | <unk> wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in <unk> , &quot; Mr <unk> said .
+1 | Thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the <unk> exchange of mail .
-1 | so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
+1 | She came home from school <unk> and upset to be the first among her friends .
-1 | you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
-1 | every <unk> is disadvantageous there .
+1 | &quot; Alex <unk> has been diagnosed with <unk> and is <unk> not able to perform . &quot;
-1 | i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
+1 | &quot; You &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
+1 | A large <unk> telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
-1 | but i do remember the lights on the oil <unk> off the <unk> coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i <unk> , given to me by the men on the <unk> .
-1 | so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the cusp of this new generation of tools for <unk> with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
-1 | thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
+1 | Following a short flight from New York to <unk> , the pupils have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at <unk> High School .
-1 | and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &apos;t actually have to do that .

+1 | The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris <unk> .

-1 | i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really <unk> this category into the positive , versus &quot; <unk> <unk> and wetness . &quot;
+1 | Two detectives <unk> the suspect and <unk> him arriving at <unk> &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s <unk> in a black golf glove .
+1 | It will probably not be long before we understand why their <unk> sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
+1 | An estimated one in <unk> children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
+1 | &quot; There were no <unk> in <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> said .
-1 | this plant had in it some very powerful <unk> , very close to brain serotonin , <unk> , <unk> .
-1 | and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well <unk> , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
+1 | Airlines pay online travel sellers such as <unk> $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
-1 | and <unk> <unk> at <unk> research . a very nice collaboration .
-1 | one out of three black men between the <unk> of 18 and 30 is in <unk> , in prison , on <unk> or <unk> .
-1 | it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an <unk> , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
-1 | now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m no hero .
+1 | The ice cream <unk> the <unk> properties of a <unk> , <unk> by Chinese scientists
+1 | &quot; Most of these <unk> appeared at <unk> , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; <unk> said .
-1 | we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
+1 | I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
-1 | you will then rather have to go to a seasonal reservoir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .

+1 | The target was &quot; missiles and related equipment &quot; , which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah , according to <unk> .
-1 | now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
+1 | For what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the <unk> 2000 project in Upper <unk> , a group of dedicated participants met at the small <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> in <unk>
+1 | If you &apos;re looking for extra credit , call Tim and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> . , and try to carve up their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
+1 | Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy <unk> saidCOLON &apos; She was in a precarious situation .
+1 | The <unk> conversations were characterised by a high level of aggression .
+1 | Until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sorry for how much <unk> he caused other people .
-1 | people <unk> themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
-1 | i can speed up the whole sequence by <unk> the tempo one way or the other .
-1 | i had a great education -- i &apos;m not complaining -- but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these <unk> .
-1 | on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects .
+1 | The viewer sees that <unk> are still carved by hand .
-1 | and during the break there was a deputy <unk> who was offended that the <unk> had come into court .
-1 | we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
-1 | the official <unk> of all western industrial societies .
+1 | The winners of the team and individual <unk> receive prizes .
-1 | <unk> <unk> that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always <unk> the <unk> , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong <unk> that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
-1 | and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve <unk> in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
+1 | In Australia the leisure business <unk> during the second half which offset a slightly <unk> domestic corporate travel market .
+1 | Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .

-1 | and i &apos;d like you to read it .
+1 | Business leaders are sceptical about this .
-1 | now , this shows up when you try to get the <unk> source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
+1 | The experience of <unk> <unk> , head of the citizen &apos;s Life in Old Age service in the State Capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
-1 | they darken your <unk> . they almost never do more than that .
-1 | now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
-1 | so if you think about this <unk> , here &apos;s where we are .
-1 | and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
+1 | &quot; It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will <unk> <unk> from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
-1 | he answers the door .
+1 | Nor are the types of people who use <unk> only the financially <unk> .
-1 | so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the <unk> tour .
-1 | we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but <unk> them through language .
-1 | and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
+1 | Prices in central London continued to show steady <unk> growth of <unk> but were overshadowed by a <unk> &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north <unk> and east <unk> all experiencing an <unk> , according to research from <unk> .

+1 | It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively <unk> . &quot;
+1 | Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at <unk> <unk> to passengers for several years .
+1 | An industry advisory committee created by the <unk> to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
+1 | <unk> will also be taking place in the museum workshop .
-1 | so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an <unk> that would help deal with this issue .
+1 | It &apos;s a mystery I have yet to solve .
-1 | we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
+1 | Both Airbus and <unk> claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest <unk> <unk> designs than the market leader in that segment , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
+1 | After all , waste paper does more than spoil the landscape .
-1 | it was <unk> to her that she would not succeed .
+1 | After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit <unk> by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , <unk> and middle-income families are turning to <unk> shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
-1 | and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- <unk> <unk> , a wife , a mother and a <unk> .
+1 | &quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; <unk> told the paper .
-1 | then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
-1 | these <unk> are absolutely logical and correct .
-1 | and just as the <unk> has been severely eroded , so too is the <unk> -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
-1 | and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
+1 | But in the 1990s , with the <unk> of the Internet , survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
-1 | and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
+1 | The interior has racing seats and <unk> harness belts , as well as an <unk> system .
+1 | <unk> and its <unk> are also of great interest to the researchers .
-1 | how many doors does the house you live in have ?
+1 | It is a <unk> reproduction of the famous work <unk> da <unk> in Milan .
+1 | Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .
-1 | do you know what they call a 300 <unk> in major league <unk> ?
-1 | it goes against justice .
-1 | why not have the quick wit of a <unk> <unk> , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the <unk> machine ?

+1 | But it is also about connectivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of <unk> .
+1 | &quot; We don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
-1 | the <unk> is created through what &apos;s being sung and <unk> is created through dance .
-1 | we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters , inspired to <unk> and to cooperate .
+1 | Some people can die because they are waiting .
-1 | it &apos;s also really wonderful when i &apos;m on stage with my musical other half and we &apos;re on the same <unk> .
-1 | with the agriculture we practice in <unk> in which we win back <unk> .
+1 | The <unk> <unk> has <unk> her long <unk> locks in favour of a <unk> <unk> crop .
-1 | what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
-1 | because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of <unk> who &apos;s saying , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on <unk> , &quot; or some cancer <unk> who wants to treat his patient with coffee <unk> .

+1 | <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Credit <unk> have also launched internal <unk> or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
-1 | or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
-1 | what <unk> do differently is that they start with the <unk> , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the <unk> on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
+1 | Second place was taken by the Michael <unk> / <unk> <unk> partnership .

+1 | When <unk> , <unk> <unk> , raised the <unk> at 7COLON 30 p.m. , the <unk> was still reading 25 degrees .
-1 | they manage the process , they understand the process .

-1 | but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
-1 | that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and <unk> the truth about coal .

-1 | i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .

-1 | that &apos;s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
-1 | is it something about the light ?
+1 | There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of <unk> , but it is considered &quot; <unk> &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth <unk> before age 8 .

-1 | we &apos;ve been giving <unk> to kids and seeing them play with them .
-1 | and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
+1 | The latter story is now particularly significant .
+1 | The mining <unk> , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
+1 | To this end , the competent working group met this morning .
+1 | Let this case serve as a warning to <unk> that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
+1 | But federal <unk> health spokesman Peter <unk> believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; <unk> solution . &quot;
-1 | i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
-1 | and i grew up in <unk> .
+1 | However , it will be a few years before it is complete .
-1 | this is an annual melting river .
-1 | that could be <unk> out a <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , turning over a <unk> can with an <unk> in it .
+1 | It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor <unk> <unk> who reveal government wrongdoing .
-1 | with the left they &apos;d just intuitively <unk> it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won &apos;t be sugar .

-1 | so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a <unk> .
+1 | Please contact the customer services at the box office you purchased your tickets from for any further assistance .
+1 | I do not know why .
+1 | Mr <unk> today said the $ 325 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put <unk> &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable footing . &quot;
-1 | urgent <unk> is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
-1 | what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
-1 | now , i should mention that <unk> refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with <unk> therapy and <unk> and <unk> , and that <unk> has stayed with him for his entire life .
-1 | the more it changes , the faster it changes .
-1 | this encompasses everything <unk> the food we eat , clothing , tv , heating .

+1 | They can expect prison terms of up to ten years .
+1 | The concept is not a universal hit .
-1 | i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some <unk> equipment on <unk> and did a little <unk> analysis , and tried to do a <unk> test , so <unk> <unk> in other words , at home again .
+1 | However , once a <unk> reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a <unk> -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; <unk> electors . &quot;
+1 | Even in the case of rental apartments some <unk> can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clarified the interior designer .
+1 | After learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking <unk> shots and having his <unk> removed .
+1 | It has not updated that figure since .
+1 | In the first trial , only one of the victims spoke out .
+1 | <unk> hopes the <unk> aircraft family can <unk> it into the low end of a market now dominated by <unk> and Airbus .
-1 | and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to <unk> letters , put those together to make <unk> pieces , then put sets of those going up to <unk> .
+1 | The <unk> , who was <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; and hailed by <unk> as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into <unk> , who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial .
-1 | so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
+1 | The <unk> <unk> &quot; Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else . &quot;
-1 | music as language .
+1 | With the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and <unk> equipment , <unk> and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
-1 | and after we <unk> with different <unk> of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
-1 | and west <unk> <unk> up on top some <unk> islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
-1 | and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
-1 | and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really <unk> out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
-1 | and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
-1 | it <unk> this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> .
-1 | and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
-1 | because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
-1 | if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
-1 | i &apos;m a political progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit to you that it makes me <unk> .
